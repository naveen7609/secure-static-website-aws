### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **User**

   * End-user or browser that wants to access your website.
   * Makes a request via **HTTP** to the S3 website endpoint.

2. **Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting**

   * Hosts the website files.
   * This is **the free-tier service** that serves your static content.
   * Receives user requests and returns the website files.

3. **Public Read Access (Bucket Policy)**

   * Allows users to read files like `index.html` and `error.html`.
   * Permissions are **controlled carefully** to prevent write or delete operations.
   * This ensures the bucket is **secure, even though it’s publicly readable**.

4. **Website Files in S3 Bucket**

   * `index.html` → main page of your site
   * `error.html` → error page when a URL is wrong
   * `robots.txt` → blocks search engines (optional, for security)
   * All files are stored **encrypted at rest (SSE-S3)** to protect data inside AWS.

5. **Versioning Enabled**

   * Protects against accidental file deletion or overwriting.
   * Enables rolling back to a previous version if needed.

### **How to Turn This into a Diagram**

* **Top Box:** User → Label as “HTTP Request”

* **Middle Box:** S3 Static Website Hosting → Connect arrow from User

* **Next Layer:** Bucket Files (index.html, error.html, robots.txt)

* **Side Labels:**

  * Encryption (SSE-S3)
  * Bucket Policy (Public Read)
  * Versioning Enabled

* **Optional Note:** Add a side note:

  > “HTTPS not available in free-tier. Production version would use CloudFront + WAF for secure access.”
